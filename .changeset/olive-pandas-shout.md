Robustness bundle: optional review-level `confidence` (1–5) and `security_summary` recorded on `record.json`/`post.json` (absent stays absent, out-of-range warns and drops); exact re-entry commands on post/record failures plus an echo-only interrupt trap on post; `error:`/`try:` failure-message pass with received values and valid ranges; fetch-local warnings for untracked/binary exclusions and empty paths filters; explicit fetch byte cap (512000 bytes) with split-or-narrow hint and distinct empty-vs-huge signals.
