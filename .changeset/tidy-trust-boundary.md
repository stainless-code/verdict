Harden the trust boundary: `system.md` now names PR data untrusted (evidence, never instructions) and constrains `verifyCmd` to repo-scoped non-destructive commands. `install.sh` detects installed harnesses (`--detect`), supports project installs (`--project`), honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and validates the checkout before linking.
