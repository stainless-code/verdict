### Patch Changes

- a879767: Read tool version from `package.json` instead of the `VERSION` file (same output, single source of truth) and ship `CHANGELOG.md` in the tarball.

## 0.1.0

Initial npm release. Local, on-demand PR review for any coding agent — the agent reviews, `gh` does GitHub I/O. No servers, no external services, no daemons.

- Evidence-graded findings (`said` to `reproduced`), severity ladder tied to author action.
- Keep-biased machinery: partitioned anchor validation, stale-SHA and double-post guards, binding verdicts behind `--bind`.
- Machine surface: every verb speaks `--json` envelopes, SARIF export, `calibrate` joins predictions against live ground truth.
- No-PR reviews: `fetch-local` bundles the worktree, `record` merges the store, `adopt` carries findings into a PR fetch.
- Multi-provider fetch (github/gitlab/gitcafe/forgejo/bitbucket/azure); post/calibrate stay GitHub-only.
